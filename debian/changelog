john (1.6-40.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency for RC bugfix.
  * The following bug fixes are mostly cherry-picked from an omnibus patch
    by Justin Pryzby <justinpryzby@users.sourceforge.net>:
  * Complete rewrite of maintainer scripts to neither remove nor edit
    conffiles (Closes: #375850)
     - the debconf settings are not necessary for package operation,
       so just don't use debconf, and remove debconf-related files from
       debian directory (incidentally closes: #412797)
     - preserves settings in preinst, rather than moving conffiles to
       foo.old
     - do the conffile relocation in preinst (not postinst, which
       inhibits dpkg diffs when they should be displayed)
     - the cronjob in /etc/cron.d does nothing if the executable isn't
       +x, so doesn't need to be commented out on uninstallation
     - minor edits to debian/README to reflect these changes
  * Set /var/run/john to mode 0700 in postinst configure unless a
    dpkg-statoverride exists (Closes: #403855)
  * On uninstallation, remove restore file from /var/lib, not /usr/share;
    and do so in postrm remove, not prerm remove.  On upgrade, if restore
    file exists in /usr/share but not in /var/lib, move it in postinst.

john (1.7-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Patches changes:
    - Drop the am64 patch (the AMD 64 bugs are fixed upstream and the patch
      introduced new bugs)
    - Drop the makefile patch (test code, should have been removed a long
      time ago)
    Neither are needed for these release any more
  * Build changes:
    - Use the MMX for i386 and amd64 and let john use the runtime fallback
      if MMX is not present
    - Introduce a build-john-stamp target in debian/rules to prevent cdbs from running the
      build/john target twice (lead to FTBFS)
  * Documentation changeS:
    - Add doc/CONTACT to the documentation under debian/docs
    - Added a debian/TODO
    - Ofuscate the email addresses in the Debian manpages as
      requested by Solar Designer
    - Review the manpage and add double dashes to all options and equal
      signs (GNU-style syntax). It still needs to be reviewed to adapt
      it to 1.7...

    pointing there, just in case)

john (1.6-28) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ported debian/rules to use CDBS
    - Removed debian/conffiles, debhelper handles this
    - Uses debian/dirs and others instead of polluting debian/rules
    - Made cleanups and removed things that remained there from older
      releases, such as unnecessary directories
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1.1
  * Moved manpages to section 8 (Closes: #252206)
  - Fixed problems (Closes: #252506)
  * Re-added sparc support with generic target (Closes: #220928)
  * Added real alternative to suggestion on wordlist
  * Removed lintian/linda overrides, don't need them anymore
  * Moved configuration files to /etc/john/ (Closes: #141741, #229597)
  * Only check for configuration file in config if it's an upgrade
    (Closes: #251227, #253194)
  * Added patch from Goswin von Brederlow to avoid segfaults when
    casting signed char to unsigned int on amd64 (Closes: #251095)
  * Added clarification to the manpage about having to run john with
    -show from the same directory where the password was cracked, so
    that it works (Closes: #228750)
  [ Javier Fernandez-Sanguino ]
  * Build on all architectures Debian supports, using the 'generic'
    target for the ones not supported by john (Closes: #138689, #224883)
  * Major rewrite of the cronjob which will now work as follows:
    - Mailer uses the latest password file to avoid mailing users warning
      about passwords if they have changed it (Closes: #251172)
    - Stale files are now removed under some circunstances (so /var/run/john
      does not fill up with cronpasswd files)
    - John is started/stopped using start-stop-daemon which makes it
      write the pid file properly (unlike previously). Also,
      the start-stop-daemon usage makes it possible to run john as a
      non-root user (if everything is 'chowned' to him).
    - This new cronjob will now restore interrupted sessions correctly
      (and uses the john.rec files) (Closes: #213164)

  not chosen to replace it.

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Mon, 17 Nov 2003 01:05:47 +0100

john (1.6-23) unstable; urgency=low

  user is removing the package and has enabled the cronjob (Closes: #220845)

john (1.6-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release wouldn't have been possible without the help from Jeronimo
    Pellegrini and Gergely Nagy. Both were a great help for me and so it's
    only fair to credit them here and say a big "THANK YOU"!
  * john will create now the files john.pot, john.ini and restore in the
    directory where it was started from.
  * Changed the unshadow.1 manpage as suggested by Colin Watson. This means
    that one occurance of .br was replaced by .PP and an newline was added.
    This will address the issue of the slightly broken unshadow manpage,
    that has been reported as bug #142848.
  * The manpage john.1 won't mention the non-existing john-ini.5 anymore. This
    is going to fix the bug #122438.
  * Integrated two patches from Jeronimo Pellegrini that are going to improve
    the cronjob. Also thanks to Gergely Nagy for his help with devising and
    developing the patches. This should address bug #162991.
  * Also the whole setup and behaviour of the cronjob has been modified. This
    should also fix the bug #118012 since the code has been changed.
  * Updated the URL pointer in the FAQ. This should fix the bug report
    #159580.
  * Changed the wrong comment in the file /etc/john-mail.conf. This will fix
    the bug #162599.
  * Fixed the location of password.lst and the location of the files for the
    incremental mode in /etc/john.ini. This will fix the bugreport #79831.
  * Reworked support for translation of debconf messages. Now this package is
    using po-debconf for this purpose.
